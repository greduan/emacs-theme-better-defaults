# Contributing Guidelines

Here are some guidelines to follow when contributing to this repo or any repo
that I (Greduan) own or maintain.

## If you are contributing with a bug report, feature request etc.

Please make it as detailed as possible.  If you just tell me you are getting an
error, that doesn't allow me to help you at all, thus I won't help you.

Also make sure that the bug hasn't been reported already, if it has been your
issue will be closed and you will be pointed to the existing issue.

When reporting a bug, I expect the following information:

- What you were doing when you got the error.
- What you expected to happen and what _actually_ happened.
- If you get an error message, please post it.
- The versions of stuff.
    - Your OS version.
    - The version of my software.
    - The version of your browser (if it applies).
    - If software is running on a platform (e.g. Java, Node.js etc.) also post
      the version of that.
- If possible, a GIF of the bug.

These are just guidelines, they are not rules, but treat them as if they were.
Simply post _as much_ information as you possibly can, in order to make the
process of fixing the problem as easy as possible for me.

Of course, if it is a feature request you only have to explain in detail what
you would like, how it would work, why you would like it etc.

## If you are contributing with code

1. Fork the repo.

2. Make a new branch for your feature or bug fix.  Optionally, you can name it
   in one of the following ways:
    - If a bug fix, name it 'bug-*', where * is whatever you prefer to name it.
    - If a new feature, name it 'feature-', where * is whatever you prefer to
      name it.

3. Make your changes and commit them, make sure your commit messages are not
   rambling commit messages: <http://stopwritingramblingcommitmessages.com/>
   Commit with whichever frequency you prefer, if possible keep the commits
   frequent, because that's how I prefer commits.

4. Open a pull request for your bug/feature branch.  Open it for the 'dev'
   branch, if there is one, if there isn't open it for the 'master' branch.
   Make sure to make the pull request informative of what your pull request
   does, how etc., make it easy for me to pull it in.

If possible, please provide a GIF with the change so I can see it right away
without having to pull, makes it quicker.

## The CONTRIBUTORS file

By making a pull request to this project and it being pulled in you will
automatically be added to the CONTRIBUTORS file by me.  If you'd like to be
exempted from this just say so in the pull request.

You can also add your line to the pull request or tell me what you'd like the
line to be.  If you don't, I will make a line according to your name and
username, using the email with which you have Git set up.
